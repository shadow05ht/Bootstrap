    <p class="text-danger">A motorcycle (motorbike, bike, or trike (if three-wheeled)) is a two or three-wheeled motor
        vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle-style seat.
        Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting,
        cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved
        in other related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.
        The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal
        combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first series production
        motorcycle.</p>

    <p class="text-danger">Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. In 2021,
        approximately 58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world,fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over
        the same period.In 2022, the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, and
        Suzuki. In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel
        economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions,
        excluding car-centric Japan.[citation needed.</p>

    <p class="text-danger">According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile
        traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.
        The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen. It was designed and built
        by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt, Germany, in 1885.[10] This
        vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees
        of steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle
        dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while
        turning.

    <p class="text-danger">The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see § Legal
        definitions and restrictions).

        There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there are
        many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each type, such as
        road racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt bikes.

        Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types. Off-road motorcycles
        include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in most
        areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but include features to make them
        legal and comfortable on the street as well.

        Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a different
        riding posture.</p>

    <p class="text-danger">The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a 5⁄8 hp (0.47 kW), 40 cc (2.4 cu in) displacement, 2+1⁄4 in × 5 in (57 mm × 127 mm) bore × stroke, flat twin four-stroke engine (with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery) equipped with rotary valves and a float-fed carburettor (five years before Maybach) and Ackermann steering, all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air. The engine was liquid-cooled, with a radiator over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels. It was not, however, a success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.</p>
